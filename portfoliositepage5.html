    <hr>
                <p1 style="color: black; text-align: left; font-size: larger; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The cheap jolt of a jumpscare and the sticky abundance of familiar blood and gore are not half so disturbing as the mouldering foulness of old buildings and the half-formed not-shapes of an unpleasant dream. Perhaps to return the horror genre to its original novelty, we must embrace the ludicrous premises of our own bad dreams with earnestness. I try to tread a line between Junji Ito, Stephen King, Masahiro Ito (no relation to the former), and David Lynch. This is not to say that rust, blood, violence, and sharp pointy bits aren't frightening; but rather, that they work best interspersed with what isn't an immediate or conventional threat as design elements. If you see a hulking, snarling werewolf, you'll likely think, "Oh damn, I'm in danger!" If instead you are pursued by a porcelain tea kettle with twelve crystalline spider legs emerging asymmetrically from its cracks; and this pursuit is ongoing as the kettle-spider constantly emits a disturbingly clown-like soft, whimpering chuckle, you will instead think "Oh God, what on Earth, what is this thing even going to DO to me?!" That is the surreal nature of true nightmares, and a delicate balance I seek to preserve myself. Less gore, more "WTF?"</p1>
