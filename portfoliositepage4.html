    <hr>
                <p1 style="color: black; text-align: left; font-size: larger; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Much like the artistic tropes found in designing armor, fiction has grown swamped with a number of design flaws and exaggerations that have come to personally annoy me. Unless something is insanely badass and befitting of exaggerated size (i.e., chainsaw swords, rocket-powered hammers), there is absolutely no reason to add additional bulk to an armament. Can a weapon be exaggeratedly large in relation to what is necessary for its user? Almost certainly. But there is a difference between the attenuated, claw-like length of the Alucard Blade from Castlevania, and say, the utterly preposterous lump of whatever that conglomeration Blizzard's Lich-King was using was. A sword/axe/mace/spear/etc. ought to still resemble what it is, instead of a modern art sculpture in the vague outline of one. And if it is extremely alien to the typical form and cross-section, the weapon should belong to a creature just as unnatural. A bog-standard human YA novel protagonist should not have a 13-foot-long nightmare in the shape of a quadruple helix of barbed wire unless they specifically have been cursed and fused with the sword. Exaggeration must fit thematically, or it becomes clownish instead.</p1>
